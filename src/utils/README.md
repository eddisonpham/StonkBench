# `src/utils/`

This directory contains general-purpose utility functions that are not specific to any single domain (e.g., data ingestion, modeling, or evaluation). These utilities are designed to be reusable across multiple parts of the project and include functionalities like path management, data I/O helpers, performance measurement, mathematical operations, and console display tools.
